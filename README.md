# Beckn Protocol Mobility Specification
Recommendations for beckn protocol-enabled mobiity application developers

## Latest Version

0.8.0

This version is an adaptation of beckn protocol [core version 0.9.4 LTS](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications/tree/core-0.9.4)

## Earlier Versions

The earlier versions of beckn protocol for mobility was in-sync with core. Hence, the version number for mobility was equal to the version number of core, To visit these versions, visit the core protocol specification repository.

## Introduction

Beckn protocol is a collection of open specifications consisting of protocol APIs, message formats, network design and reference architectures to allow any two entities to execute commercial transactions without being on the same platform. The core protocol specifications are industry-sector-agnostic by design and allow sector-specific policies to be layered as machine readable code.    

This server-to-server communication protocol allows any consumer facing online platform to discover and transact with any business with minimal implementation overhead. The server-to-server nature of the protocol allows rich user experiences to be built by bundling services from multiple independent platforms. 

**Beckn protocol mobility specification** is an adaptation of the [core protocol specification](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) for the mobility sector and applies mobility specific rules and policies on its API and architecture to allow the creation of Open Mobility Networks. A reference mobility ecosystem created using beckn mobility specification can be found [here](https://github.com/beckn/mobility/blob/main/docs/images/Ecosystem%20Architecture.png)

## Evolution

The evolution of the beckn protocol mobility specification is guided by the recommendations of the **Mobillty Working Group**. It consistes of volunteers from the **Beckn Open Collective**, a thriving community of volunteers that actively contribute to beckn protocol, its adaptations, and its implementations across various sectors.
