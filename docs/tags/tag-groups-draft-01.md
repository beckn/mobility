# Tag Groups

Tag groups are labels under which various tags can be grouped. In the mobility sector, Tag Groups can contains various service-specific information. Tag Groups can be standardized at a domain-level or a network-level depending upon implementer demand for standardizations. Some examples of Tag Groups are shown below. 

Note: The below list is NOT a recommended or required standard. This list will be standardized on the basis of adoption by implementers.
